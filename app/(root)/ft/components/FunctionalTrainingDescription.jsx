        Functional training is a way of exercising that helps your body move
        better in everyday life. Instead of focusing on just one muscle, it
        trains your whole body to work together. This makes it easier to do
        things like walking, lifting, running, or playing sports. For example,
        when you pick up groceries, your body uses many muscles at once.
        Functional training helps those muscles get stronger and work better
        together so you don't get hurt and can move with more power and control.
